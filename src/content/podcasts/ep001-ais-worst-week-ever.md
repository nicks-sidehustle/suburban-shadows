## Script

Hey everyone, welcome to Hallucination Nation, the podcast where we celebrate AI's most spectacular face-plants. I'm your host, and today we're diving into what I'm calling "AI's Worst Week Ever" — a highlight reel of recent AI disasters that'll make you feel a lot better about your own Monday.

Let's start with everyone's favorite fast food fiasco. Picture this: you're at a drive-thru, and an AI is taking your order. Sounds efficient, right? Well, one customer decided to test the system by ordering "eighteen thousand cups of water." And the AI? It just... went with it. System crashed. Complete meltdown. But wait, it gets better. In another incident, the AI kept insisting that a customer add more drinks to their order. The guy kept saying no, and the AI kept asking. It was like that friend who can't take a hint at the bar. "You SURE you don't want another drink? Really sure? How about now?"

Now let's talk about the fifteen thousand dollar burger. I wish I was making this up. Multiple AI ordering systems have confidently quoted prices that would make a Michelin star restaurant blush. One person got quoted seventy bucks for a combo meal. Another was told their burger would be fifteen thousand four hundred dollars. At that point, I'd hope it comes with a side of gold bars.

But the fails aren't just at fast food joints. Virgin Money — yes, the actual bank — had to apologize because their AI content moderation system decided the word "virgin" was offensive. In their own company name. Customers couldn't even type the bank's name without getting flagged. It's like working at a place called "Fantastic Furniture" and the spam filter blocking emails with the word "fantastic." Come on, AI, use some context!

Moving on to the media. Chris Cuomo, the news host, fell for an obviously AI-generated video of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez supposedly criticizing actress Sydney Sweeney. When people pointed out it was fake, did he apologize? No! He doubled down and said, quote, "you are what's wrong with AI in the media." Sir, YOU played the fake video. That's like blaming the road when you drive into a ditch.

Speaking of driving into ditches — literally — Tesla's Full Self-Driving had quite a year. One guy in Alabama named Wally was just commuting with FSD active, staying alert like you're supposed to, when his Model 3 suddenly jerked the steering wheel, sideswiped a tree, and flipped upside down into a ditch. Wally's fine, thankfully — just needed some stitches on his chin — but his review of the feature was, shall we say, not five stars. The car's own camera caught the whole thing, and it went viral faster than you can say "your vehicle is now in supervised chaos mode."

Let's not forget the DeepSeek debacle. This Chinese AI startup launched what some called "Chinese ChatGPT" in January 2025, and it EXPLODED in popularity. Topped the App Store in the US and UK. Tech headlines called it a "Sputnik moment." So what happened next? Hackers knocked it offline almost immediately. The surge of users was so massive that combined with cyberattacks, the whole thing crumbled. New user registrations? Paused. Website? Down for the longest stretch in ninety days. It's like throwing the world's biggest party and then the roof caves in.

And then there's Nvidia's Blackwell chips — their next-gen AI hardware that was supposed to revolutionize everything. Reports came out that they were overheating and running behind schedule. Companies that budgeted billions — with a B — for AI data centers suddenly had to push their plans into 2026. When your supply chain hiccup affects trillion-dollar companies, that's not a bug, that's a feature... of chaos.

But my personal favorite from AI's worst week? The AI Darwin Awards. Yes, someone actually created a website to honor the dumbest AI fails of the year. Finally, natural selection comes for neural networks. Nominees include AI systems that invented fake professors, chatbots that gave dangerous medical advice, and image generators that apparently believe humans have three front legs.

So what's the lesson from AI's worst week ever? Well, it's pretty simple: AI is incredibly powerful, incredibly useful, and incredibly, spectacularly, confidently wrong on a regular basis. It'll quote you fifteen grand for a burger, block your bank's own name, and tell you to add glue to your pizza — all without a hint of doubt.

The technology is amazing. But so is its ability to fail in ways no human ever would. And honestly? That's kind of comforting. Because as long as AI keeps having weeks like this, we'll always have material for this podcast.
