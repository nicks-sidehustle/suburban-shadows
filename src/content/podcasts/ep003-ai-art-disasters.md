## Script

Hey everyone, welcome back to Hallucination Nation! Today's episode is all about AI art disasters, and let me tell you — artificial intelligence has given us some truly cursed images. From nightmare hands to melting faces, we're covering it all. Let's dive in.

First up: hands. Oh god, the hands. If AI image generators have one weakness, it's human hands. We're talking fingers that branch into more fingers. Thumbs where thumbs shouldn't be. Hands with six, seven, sometimes EIGHT digits. It's like the AI learned anatomy from a Lovecraft novel.

Someone asked an AI to generate a "woman doing a backflip in the rain." What they got was a humanoid figure with limbs bending in directions that would require a trip to the emergency room. The physics? Nonexistent. The rain? Sure, kind of. The backflip? Let's call it interpretive.

But hands aren't even the worst of it. There's the teeth issue. AI-generated smiles often look like someone photoshopped extra teeth into a mouth. Rows upon rows of teeth, fading into the void. Dentists everywhere are having nightmares.

Will Smith — the actual celebrity — posted a tour video on Instagram with his fans, and it went viral for all the wrong reasons. Part of the crowd was clearly AI-generated, including one fan whose hand had fused with the person in front of him. Like, MERGED. Two people, one impossible hand situation. Thirty-three thousand likes and half the comments were just people pointing out the eldritch horror in the background.

Now let's talk about text. AI art CANNOT handle text. Every attempt to include words in an AI image results in what I can only describe as "keyboard smash aesthetics." We've got "GRAGLLE" from The Simpsons instead of Marge. "SELERИOLRS" on a book cover. "SPOFN," "SFORK," and my personal favorite: "WITH A FRIFK." That last one was supposed to say "with a fork." The AI was SO close and yet so far.

The McDonald's Christmas ad debacle was a masterpiece of AI fail. Dutch McDonald's created a holiday ad using AI-generated imagery, and the result was described as "full of grotesque characters, horrible color grading, and hackneyed AI approximations of basic physics." They eventually pulled it from YouTube. Which is saying something, because YouTube has seen some things.

Christmas in general seems to break AI. Netflix released a movie poster for something called "A Very Pagan Christmas" that looked so AI-generated people started calling it "A Very AI-Generated Christmas." And then there was the AI reindeer with three front legs. I've never seen a reindeer in real life, but I'm pretty confident they have four legs distributed normally.

Here's a wild one: someone generated an image of a kitchen and got... well, a kitchen. Kind of. Except there was a mysterious opening in the top of one cabinet that led nowhere. And a second kitchen conveniently located halfway up the wall. Just a full kitchen setup, mounted at eye level, completely inaccessible. Modern design!

The exercise instruction AI fail is nightmare fuel. Someone used AI to generate workout demonstrations, and the resulting figures look possessed. We're talking Exorcist-level body positions. Spines bending the wrong way. Limbs at angles that would end careers. Please do not attempt these exercises at home or anywhere else.

AI-generated book illustrations for kids have been particularly cursed. There's one making the rounds where a child's face looks like it's melting while they read. The proportions are wrong, the eyes are unsettling, and the whole vibe is "this book is haunted." Perfect for bedtime!

And then there's the yassification of squirrels. Yes, someone used AI to make squirrels look glamorous, and the results are... you know what, I can't even describe it. Google "AI yassified squirrels" at your own risk.

The job market has been infected too. AI-generated headshots are becoming common, and they're often obviously fake. Perfect skin, weird lighting, and that telltale "slightly too smooth" look that screams "I let a robot draw me." Recruiters are using AI to write job descriptions while candidates use AI to write cover letters, and somewhere in the middle, actual humans are just vibing.

Museums have started using AI art for exhibits, and not everyone's happy. One exhibit about the accomplishments of Black women used AI-generated imagery instead of, you know, actual art by Black women. The feedback was swift and justified.

The worst part about all these fails? The confidence. AI art generators never say "I'm not sure about this hand." They just... generate a hand with seven fingers and call it a day. No disclaimer. No uncertainty. Just pure, unearned confidence in a digital nightmare.

So what's the takeaway? AI art tools are incredible for certain things — quick mockups, inspiration, weird memes. But they're not a replacement for actual artists, and they definitely can't be trusted with anything involving human anatomy, text, or basic physics.

Until AI learns how many fingers humans have, we'll have plenty of content for this podcast.

Thanks for listening to Hallucination Nation! If this episode made you laugh — or cringe — share it with a friend. And whatever you do, don't ask AI to draw your portrait. You've been warned.

Next episode, we're covering AI customer service meltdowns. Trust me, it gets personal. Until then, stay curious, stay critical, and never trust a squirrel that looks too glamorous.
