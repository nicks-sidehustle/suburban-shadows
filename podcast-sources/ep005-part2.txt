The first sign of trouble came in October 2008, when the Coleman family began receiving disturbing messages. It started with emails — anonymous, threatening communications that seemed to know intimate details about the family's daily routine.

"I know where your boys go to school," one message read. "I know what time you leave for work. I know when Sheri goes to the grocery store alone. Tell Joyce Meyer she needs better security."

The emails weren't random rantings. They demonstrated knowledge of Coleman's work schedule, his travel patterns, even the family's church attendance. The writer seemed to know that Coleman often worked late on Tuesday evenings, that Sheri took the boys to soccer practice on Thursdays, that the family typically went to dinner at a local restaurant called 54th Street Grill every Friday night.

As a security professional, Coleman knew exactly what to do. He contacted the Columbia Police Department and filed formal reports about each threatening communication. Detective Justin Barlow, who handled the initial reports, was impressed by Coleman's thoroughness and professionalism.

Coleman upgraded his home security system, installing additional cameras and motion sensors. He varied his family's routines, taking different routes to work and school. He even arranged for neighbors to keep watch when he traveled for work. To outside observers, Coleman was handling a genuine threat with textbook precision.

But the messages escalated. In November 2008, the family woke to find graffiti spray-painted on their garage door: "I'M WATCHING." A month later, someone left a dead bird on their doorstep with a note: "This is what happens to snitches."

The psychological impact on the family was devastating. Sheri, who had always been outgoing and social, became increasingly anxious and withdrawn. She started checking locks multiple times before bed, insisted on picking up the boys directly from school instead of letting them walk home, and began carrying pepper spray in her purse.

What nobody in Columbia, Illinois knew was that Chris Coleman was living a completely different life behind closed doors. While maintaining his image as a devoted Christian family man, Coleman had been conducting an intense affair with Tara Lintz, a woman he'd met through his wife's social circles.

Tara lived in Florida, which made the affair easier to conceal. Their relationship had begun innocently enough — friendly emails and phone calls that gradually became more intimate. But by 2008, Coleman was telling Tara that he was planning to leave his wife and start a new life with her.

The electronic trail of their relationship tells a story of obsession and deception that would eventually unravel Coleman's carefully constructed facade. Hundreds of emails and text messages revealed a man living a double life with remarkable skill and disturbing calculation.

"I dream about you every night," Coleman wrote to Tara in February 2009. "I can't wait until we can be together without having to hide. Soon, baby. Very soon."

But there were obstacles to Coleman's fantasies of a new life. Joyce Meyer Ministries had strict moral clauses in their employment contracts. Adultery wasn't just frowned upon — it was grounds for immediate termination. For a man who defined himself by his career and his six-figure salary, divorce represented not just the end of his marriage, but the destruction of his professional identity.

Coleman's emails to Tara became increasingly desperate as 2009 progressed. He complained about feeling trapped, about the financial obligations that would come with a divorce, about the damage to his reputation if his affair became public knowledge.

"Sometimes I feel like there's no way out," he wrote in March 2009. "Everything I've worked for, everything I've built — it could all disappear. But I love you more than my own life. We'll find a way. I promise you we'll find a way."

In the warped logic of a narcissistic mind, Coleman began to see his family not as the people he'd promised to love and protect, but as obstacles to his happiness. The threatening messages, which had initially seemed like a crisis to be managed, began to look like an opportunity.
