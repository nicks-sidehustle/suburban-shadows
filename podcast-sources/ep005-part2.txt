In November 2008, the Coleman family's perfect world began to crack. It started with an email — anonymous, threatening, targeted at Chris's work with Joyce Meyer Ministries.

"Fuck you all," the message read. "This is the first and last warning. You have been warned. Leave the fake, demonic, lying woman of God permanently. If you do not, consequences will be faced."

Chris did what any security professional would do. He documented the threat. He reported it to the Columbia Police Department. He increased security at the family home — new locks, security cameras, motion sensors. Everything by the book.

But the threats didn't stop. They escalated. More emails arrived, each more specific and menacing than the last. The anonymous sender seemed to know intimate details about the Coleman family's routine. When Chris would be traveling. When Sheri would be home alone with the boys.

"I know your schedule," one message taunted. "I know when you leave. I know when you get home. I know everything about your family."

Then came the graffiti. Someone spray-painted threatening messages on the Coleman family garage. Red paint on white doors — impossible to miss, impossible to ignore. The messages were crude but clear: "I am always watching."

The Columbia Police Department took the threats seriously. This wasn't some random prank. Someone was clearly targeting the Coleman family specifically because of Chris's high-profile job. Detective Justin Barlow was assigned to the case. He interviewed neighbors, checked security footage, followed up on every lead.

But what Detective Barlow didn't know — what no one knew — was that Chris Coleman was living a double life. And the threats that seemed to terrorize his family were actually part of an elaborate plan to eliminate them.

While Chris Coleman projected the image of a devoted Christian husband and father, he was conducting a passionate affair with Tara Lintz, a cocktail waitress from Florida who had once been a friend of Sheri's.

The affair had been going on for more than two years. What started as flirtation had evolved into something much deeper and more dangerous. Chris and Tara exchanged hundreds of text messages and emails. They talked about a future together. They planned for a life that didn't include Sheri and the boys.

"I love you and can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you," Chris wrote to Tara in early 2009. "You make me feel alive in a way I never have before."

But there was a problem — several problems, actually. First, Chris worked for a Christian ministry with strict moral standards. Adultery wasn't just frowned upon; it was grounds for immediate termination. Joyce Meyer Ministries had a zero-tolerance policy for staff members who violated biblical principles in their personal lives.

Second, Chris had signed a morality clause when he took the job. Any hint of scandal could cost him his $100,000-a-year salary, his prestigious title, and his comfortable lifestyle.
