# Suburban Shadows - Episode 005: The Security Expert (Extended)

## INTRO - AI TRANSPARENCY & SETTING

The American suburb promises safety. Tree-lined streets where children ride bicycles without fear. Neighborhoods where everyone knows their neighbors, where trust isn't just expected — it's the foundation of daily life.

I'm Marcus Cole, and I want to be transparent with you from the start — I'm an AI host, created to tell these stories with the care and respect they deserve. While my voice may be artificial, the crimes we explore are devastatingly real, and their impact on real families and communities demands nothing less than our full attention.

This is Suburban Shadows, where we peel back the curtain on the dark secrets that lurk behind America's most picture-perfect facades.

Tonight, we're traveling to Columbia, Illinois — a small city of just over 10,000 residents, nestled between St. Louis and the Mississippi River. It's the kind of place where Friday night high school football games are community events, where neighbors still wave from their front porches, and where local police officers know residents by name.

In this idyllic setting, one family seemed to embody everything suburban America aspired to be. The Colemans lived on Robert Drive, in a neighborhood of well-maintained homes where the American flag flies proudly and children's laughter echoes from backyards. 

But in May 2009, this peaceful community would learn a horrifying truth: sometimes the greatest danger doesn't come from outside the neighborhood. Sometimes, it comes from the very person sworn to keep others safe.

## PART ONE: THE PERFECT SUBURBAN FAMILY

Chris Coleman was 32 years old in 2009, and by all appearances, he was living the American Dream. Standing six feet tall with an athletic build, Coleman carried himself with the quiet confidence of a man who knew how to handle any situation. His neighbors on Robert Drive knew him as the friendly guy who coached Little League, who helped elderly Mrs. Patterson with her groceries, who never missed his sons' school events.

Coleman had married his high school sweetheart, Sheri DeMark, in a storybook wedding that their hometown of Chester, Illinois, still talked about years later. Sheri, a petite blonde with an infectious laugh, had been a cheerleader and honor student. Those who knew her described a woman who lived for her family — a devoted mother who volunteered at school functions, organized neighborhood barbecues, and somehow managed to make even grocery shopping look effortless.

Their home at 6 Robert Drive was the embodiment of suburban perfection. A two-story colonial with cream-colored siding and black shutters, it boasted a manicured lawn that Coleman maintained with military precision. The front porch featured hanging baskets of flowers that Sheri tended with care. Inside, the home was immaculately decorated with family photos that told the story of their seemingly perfect life: Christmas mornings, family vacations, Little League victories.

Eleven-year-old Garett was the serious one — studious, responsible, already showing signs of inheriting his father's analytical mind. Nine-year-old Gavin was the family comedian, always ready with a joke or a smile that could light up a room. Both boys were honor students at Parkview Elementary School, where teachers described them as polite, well-behaved children who clearly came from a loving home.

The family attended Grace Church faithfully, sitting in the same pew every Sunday. Pastor Mike Smith would later describe Chris as a man who seemed genuinely committed to his faith and family. "He was the kind of father you'd want for your own children," Smith would tell investigators. "Always asking how he could be a better husband and father."

But Chris Coleman's most impressive credential was his career. As head of security for Joyce Meyer Ministries, one of America's most prominent televangelism organizations, Coleman was responsible for protecting a woman who preached to millions worldwide. Meyer's ministry generated over $100 million annually, and her international speaking engagements required sophisticated security planning.

Coleman's job took him around the world — from megachurches in Texas to conference centers in Australia. He coordinated with international law enforcement, analyzed threat assessments, and managed security teams of former military and law enforcement professionals. His annual salary of $100,000 placed him well above the median income for Columbia, Illinois, and his colleagues respected his expertise and professionalism.

To understand Chris Coleman's reputation, you have to understand the world of executive protection. This isn't just about standing around looking intimidating. Modern security work requires understanding crowd dynamics, threat assessment, emergency evacuation procedures, and coordination with local law enforcement. Coleman had trained with some of the best in the business, and his references from previous positions were sterling.

"Chris was the kind of guy you trusted with your life," said Mark Williams, a former colleague who worked international security details with Coleman. "He was methodical, professional, and absolutely dedicated to keeping people safe. If someone had told me what he was planning, I would never have believed it."

## PART TWO: STORM CLOUDS GATHERING

The first sign of trouble came in October 2008, when the Coleman family began receiving disturbing messages. It started with emails — anonymous, threatening communications that seemed to know intimate details about the family's daily routine.

"I know where your boys go to school," one message read. "I know what time you leave for work. I know when Sheri goes to the grocery store alone. Tell Joyce Meyer she needs better security."

The emails weren't random rantings. They demonstrated knowledge of Coleman's work schedule, his travel patterns, even the family's church attendance. The writer seemed to know that Coleman often worked late on Tuesday evenings, that Sheri took the boys to soccer practice on Thursdays, that the family typically went to dinner at a local restaurant called 54th Street Grill every Friday night.

As a security professional, Coleman knew exactly what to do. He contacted the Columbia Police Department and filed formal reports about each threatening communication. Detective Justin Barlow, who handled the initial reports, was impressed by Coleman's thoroughness and professionalism.

"Chris came in with everything documented," Barlow would later testify. "He had printed out emails, saved voicemails, even taken photographs of suspicious cars he'd noticed in his neighborhood. He seemed genuinely concerned for his family's safety, and he was doing everything right from a security standpoint."

Coleman upgraded his home security system, installing additional cameras and motion sensors. He varied his family's routines, taking different routes to work and school. He even arranged for neighbors to keep watch when he traveled for work. To outside observers, Coleman was handling a genuine threat with textbook precision.

But the messages escalated. In November 2008, the family woke to find graffiti spray-painted on their garage door: "I'M WATCHING." A month later, someone left a dead bird on their doorstep with a note: "This is what happens to snitches."

The psychological impact on the family was devastating. Sheri, who had always been outgoing and social, became increasingly anxious and withdrawn. She started checking locks multiple times before bed, insisted on picking up the boys directly from school instead of letting them walk home, and began carrying pepper spray in her purse.

The boys, initially confused by the changes to their routine, began asking difficult questions. Why couldn't they ride their bikes in the neighborhood anymore? Why did Daddy have to check their rooms every night before they went to bed? Why did Mommy seem so scared all the time?

Friends and neighbors rallied around the Coleman family. The Grace Church congregation organized prayer circles and offered to help with transportation and childcare. Neighbors formed an informal watch group, keeping an eye on the Coleman house when the family was away.

"We all felt so helpless," said neighbor Janet Patterson. "Here was this wonderful family being terrorized by some sick person, and there wasn't much any of us could do except watch and pray. Chris seemed to be handling it as well as anyone could, but you could see the strain it was putting on all of them."

## PART THREE: THE SECRET LIFE

What nobody in Columbia, Illinois knew was that Chris Coleman was living a completely different life behind closed doors. While maintaining his image as a devoted Christian family man, Coleman had been conducting an intense affair with Tara Lintz, a woman he'd met through his wife's social circles.

Tara lived in Florida, which made the affair easier to conceal. Their relationship had begun innocently enough — friendly emails and phone calls that gradually became more intimate. But by 2008, Coleman was telling Tara that he was planning to leave his wife and start a new life with her.

The electronic trail of their relationship tells a story of obsession and deception that would eventually unravel Coleman's carefully constructed facade. Hundreds of emails and text messages revealed a man living a double life with remarkable skill and disturbing calculation.

"I dream about you every night," Coleman wrote to Tara in February 2009. "I can't wait until we can be together without having to hide. Soon, baby. Very soon."

But there were obstacles to Coleman's fantasies of a new life. Joyce Meyer Ministries had strict moral clauses in their employment contracts. Adultery wasn't just frowned upon — it was grounds for immediate termination. For a man who defined himself by his career and his six-figure salary, divorce represented not just the end of his marriage, but the destruction of his professional identity.

Coleman's emails to Tara became increasingly desperate as 2009 progressed. He complained about feeling trapped, about the financial obligations that would come with a divorce, about the damage to his reputation if his affair became public knowledge.

"Sometimes I feel like there's no way out," he wrote in March 2009. "Everything I've worked for, everything I've built — it could all disappear. But I love you more than my own life. We'll find a way. I promise you we'll find a way."

The pressure was mounting from multiple directions. Sheri, despite her fears about the threatening messages, had begun asking questions about Chris's frequent phone calls and his emotional distance. She'd found suspicious charges on their credit card and had started paying closer attention to his travel schedule.

At work, Coleman's performance was suffering. Colleagues noticed he seemed distracted during planning meetings and had made several minor mistakes in security protocols during recent events. In the high-stakes world of executive protection, there's no room for error, and Coleman's supervisors were beginning to take notice.

Most importantly, Tara was growing impatient with Coleman's promises. She wanted him to leave his wife and move to Florida immediately. She'd been waiting for years for him to follow through on his commitment to her, and she was threatening to end the relationship if he didn't act soon.

In the warped logic of a narcissistic mind, Coleman began to see his family not as the people he'd promised to love and protect, but as obstacles to his happiness. The threatening messages, which had initially seemed like a crisis to be managed, began to look like an opportunity.

## PART FOUR: THE PERFECT ALIBI

In early May 2009, Chris Coleman knew he had to act quickly. Tara had given him an ultimatum: either leave his family by the end of the month, or lose her forever. His job security was becoming increasingly tenuous. And Sheri was asking more questions than ever about his behavior and his frequent absences.

Coleman's plan was methodical and chilling. As a security professional, he understood exactly what investigators would look for in a murder case. He needed an ironclad alibi, a plausible motive that pointed away from him, and a crime scene that supported his narrative of an external threat.

On May 4, 2009, Coleman sent what would be his final email to the anonymous account he'd been using to threaten his own family: "You have been warned. Tomorrow they pay the price."

That evening, Coleman tucked his boys into bed as he had thousands of times before. He helped Garett with his homework, listened to Gavin's excited chatter about an upcoming field trip, and kissed them goodnight. Then he went downstairs and made final preparations for their murder.

Coleman set multiple alarms for early the next morning and laid out his clothes for what was supposed to be a business trip to Texas with Joyce Meyer. He checked his security system one last time, ensuring that all cameras were functioning properly — he would need them to document his departure from the house.

At 5:43 AM on May 5, 2009, Coleman's home security cameras captured him leaving his house on Robert Drive. He was dressed professionally in a dark suit and carrying the travel bag he always took on business trips. To anyone watching the footage, it looked exactly like what it was supposed to look like — a devoted family man leaving for work while his wife and children slept safely in their beds.

But Coleman wasn't heading to the airport. Instead, he drove to a location where he'd previously hidden a spare set of clothes and a can of red spray paint. He changed into dark clothing, disabled his cell phone's GPS temporarily, and drove back to his neighborhood through a route he'd carefully planned to avoid most security cameras.

Using his intimate knowledge of his own security system, Coleman bypassed the alarms and entered his house through the basement. He moved through rooms where his children slept peacefully, past family photos and Little League trophies and all the remnants of the life he was about to destroy.

## PART FIVE: THE UNTHINKABLE

The murders of Sheri Coleman and her two young sons were carried out with the same methodical precision that Chris Coleman brought to his security work. There was no struggle, no signs that the victims had awakened or tried to defend themselves. Coleman's knowledge of pressure points and restraint techniques, learned through years of security training, allowed him to kill his family quickly and quietly.

Sheri was found in the master bedroom, wearing the pajamas she'd put on the night before. She'd been strangled with what investigators would later determine was a ligature — likely a rope or cord that Coleman removed from the scene. There were no defensive wounds on her hands, suggesting she'd been attacked while sleeping and never had a chance to fight back.

Eleven-year-old Garett was found in his own bed, still wearing the Chicago White Sox t-shirt he'd chosen for his pajamas. His baseball glove sat on his nightstand, ready for practice later that week that would never come. Like his mother, he'd been strangled quickly and efficiently.

Nine-year-old Gavin was discovered in his room surrounded by the artwork and school projects that covered his walls. A half-finished model airplane sat on his desk — a project he and his father had been working on together. The little boy who'd made everyone laugh was found in his Superman pajamas, clutching the stuffed animal he still slept with despite being "too old" for it.

After committing the murders, Coleman spray-painted threatening messages on the walls with red paint: "F--- YOU" in the living room and "PUNISHED" in the bedroom. The messages were designed to support his narrative of an external threat carried out by the same person who'd been sending threatening emails for months.

Coleman then left the house the same way he'd entered, carefully avoiding the security cameras whose blind spots he knew better than anyone. He changed back into his business clothes, disposed of the evidence, and continued with the charade of his alibi.

At 6:43 AM, exactly one hour after leaving his house, Coleman called his neighbor Ron Kowalski from what he claimed was a highway rest stop in Illinois, saying he was concerned because Sheri wasn't answering her phone and asking Kowalski to check on the family.

"Chris sounded genuinely worried," Kowalski would later testify. "He said he'd been trying to call Sheri all morning and it wasn't like her not to answer. He asked me to go over and knock on the door, just to make sure everything was okay."

## PART SIX: THE DISCOVERY

When Ron Kowalski arrived at 6 Robert Drive at approximately 6:50 AM, he found the front door locked and the house seemingly quiet. He knocked loudly and called out, but received no response. Growing concerned, he used the spare key that the Colemans had given him for emergencies and entered the house.

The scene that greeted him was beyond his worst nightmares. Kowalski, a Navy veteran who'd seen combat, would later say that nothing had prepared him for what he found in that suburban home.

"I called 911 immediately," Kowalski said in his statement to police. "I didn't touch anything, didn't go upstairs to check on the boys — I could tell from what I saw downstairs that this was a crime scene and I needed to preserve it for the investigators."

Columbia Police arrived within minutes, followed quickly by Illinois State Police and FBI agents who'd been monitoring the threats against the Coleman family. The small police department had never handled a triple homicide, and the complexity of the crime scene quickly overwhelmed local resources.

Detective Justin Barlow, who'd been handling the threatening messages case, was among the first officers on scene. What he saw immediately struck him as wrong.

"The spray-painted messages looked too deliberate," Barlow would later testify. "In most cases involving this kind of personal threat, you see rage, you see chaos. These messages looked like they'd been carefully planned and executed. The penmanship was too neat, the spacing too even."

More troubling was the complete absence of forced entry. Despite the sophisticated security system that Coleman had installed in response to the threats, there was no indication that anyone had broken into the house. All windows were locked from the inside. All doors showed no signs of tampering. The security system had never been triggered.

Crime scene investigators began the painstaking process of documenting every detail of the murders. They photographed the spray-painted messages, collected DNA evidence, and began reconstructing the timeline of events. What they found painted a picture that didn't match Coleman's story.

## PART SEVEN: THE INVESTIGATION UNFOLDS

As news of the triple homicide spread through Columbia, the small community went into shock. Vigils were organized at Grace Church. Flowers and stuffed animals began appearing on the lawn of 6 Robert Drive. Local news coverage described the Coleman family as innocent victims of a calculated terrorist attack.

But investigators were beginning to develop serious doubts about Chris Coleman's account of events. The timeline he'd provided didn't match the physical evidence, and his behavior during police interviews raised red flags for experienced detectives.

Illinois State Police Detective Nick Pistorius, who'd been assigned to lead the investigation, had twenty years of experience with homicide cases. Within hours of examining the crime scene, he knew the Coleman family had been killed by someone with intimate knowledge of their home and routines.

"This wasn't a random break-in," Pistorius told his team. "Someone planned this carefully, knew the family's schedule, knew the layout of the house, and knew exactly how to bypass their security system. We need to look very closely at everyone with access to that information."

Cell phone records provided the first major breakthrough in the case. While Coleman claimed to have been on the highway heading to Texas at the time of the murders, his phone had pinged cell towers near his home in Columbia between 5:43 AM and 6:30 AM on May 5th.

"The technology doesn't lie," said FBI agent Karla Heine, who'd been brought in to assist with the investigation. "Chris Coleman's phone was in Columbia, Illinois, when he claimed to be sixty miles away. That's not a margin of error — that's a deliberate deception."

Email analysis revealed even more damaging evidence. The threatening messages that had supposedly been sent by an anonymous stalker were traced back to computers and email accounts that Coleman had access to. Digital forensics experts found that many of the threats had been composed and sent during times when Coleman was alone with his computer.

Most damaging of all was the discovery of Coleman's affair with Tara Lintz. Phone records showed hundreds of calls between Coleman and Lintz in the weeks leading up to the murders. Text messages revealed Coleman's growing desperation to escape his marriage and start a new life.

"I can't wait much longer," Coleman had texted Lintz on May 3rd, just two days before the murders. "Something has to change soon. I love you and I'm going to do whatever it takes to be with you."

## PART EIGHT: THE MASK FALLS AWAY

As evidence mounted against him, Chris Coleman's facade of the grieving widower began to crumble. His behavior at the funeral service raised eyebrows among those who knew the family well.

"Chris seemed more concerned with how he looked than with mourning his family," observed Pastor Mike Smith. "He kept checking his appearance in mirrors, adjusting his tie, making sure his hair looked good for the cameras. It was like he was performing grief rather than experiencing it."

Even more disturbing were the phone records showing that Coleman had been in contact with Tara Lintz even as police were processing the crime scene where his family had been murdered. While investigators photographed his children's bodies, Coleman was sending text messages about his plans to move to Florida.

When confronted about his affair during police interviews, Coleman's story changed repeatedly. First, he denied any romantic relationship with Lintz, claiming they were just friends. When presented with explicit text messages, he admitted to the affair but claimed it had ended months earlier. When confronted with recent communications, he finally acknowledged the ongoing relationship but insisted it had nothing to do with the murders.

Detective Pistorius had interviewed hundreds of suspects during his career, but Coleman's behavior stood out for its calculated coldness.

"Most people, when they're accused of murdering their family, show some kind of genuine emotion," Pistorius said. "Anger, fear, confusion — something real. Chris Coleman showed us nothing but manufactured responses. He was performing what he thought a grieving husband should say and do, but there was nothing authentic about it."

The investigation also revealed the financial motive behind the murders. Coleman carried a $1 million life insurance policy on his wife and substantial policies on both children. If convicted of killing them, he wouldn't be able to collect the money — but if they'd been murdered by an external threat, he would have become a very wealthy widower.

## PART NINE: JUSTICE SERVED

On April 19, 2011, after a trial that captivated Illinois and made national news, Chris Coleman was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

The prosecution, led by State's Attorney Kris Reitz, presented a methodical case that painted Coleman as a narcissistic killer who valued his image and income more than his family's lives. Expert witnesses testified about the impossibility of Coleman's alibi, the digital evidence linking him to the threatening messages, and the careful planning that had gone into the murders.

"Chris Coleman didn't just kill his wife and children," Reitz told the jury in his closing argument. "He terrorized them for months with anonymous threats. He made them live in fear, made them change their daily routines, made them feel unsafe in their own home. And then he used that campaign of terror as cover for their murder."

The defense, led by attorney William Margulis, argued that investigators had rushed to judgment and ignored evidence of external threats. They suggested that the real killer remained at large while an innocent man was being prosecuted for crimes he didn't commit.

"The Columbia Police Department and Illinois State Police decided Chris Coleman was guilty from day one," Margulis argued. "They ignored evidence that didn't fit their theory and built a case around circumstantial evidence and speculation."

But the jury wasn't convinced. After deliberating for just over four hours, they returned guilty verdicts on all three murder charges. Several jurors would later say that Coleman's complete lack of emotion during the trial had convinced them of his guilt more than any single piece of evidence.

"A innocent man doesn't sit there like a statue while prosecutors describe how his children were murdered," said juror Patricia Hess. "Chris Coleman showed us nothing — no tears, no anger, no human emotion at all. That told us everything we needed to know about who he really was."

## EPILOGUE: SHADOWS THAT REMAIN

The house at 6 Robert Drive sits empty now, nearly fifteen years after the Coleman family murders. The cream-colored siding has faded, the black shutters need paint, and weeds grow where Sheri's flower baskets once hung. No family has been able to make it home for very long — the weight of what happened there seems to seep through the walls.

Chris Coleman remains in prison at the Western Illinois Correctional Center, serving three consecutive life sentences. He has maintained his innocence, filing multiple appeals that have all been denied. He receives few visitors and has become something of a pariah even among the prison population, where crimes against children are viewed with particular revulsion.

The Grace Church community eventually healed, but they carry the scars of what happened to one of their own families. Pastor Mike Smith, who conducted the funeral service for Sheri, Garett, and Gavin, says the tragedy changed how he counsels families and how he thinks about the difference between appearing godly and actually living according to Christian principles.

"Chris Coleman fooled us all," Smith admits. "He looked like the perfect Christian husband and father. He said all the right things, did all the right things — at least in public. But faith isn't a performance. Character isn't something you can fake indefinitely. Eventually, who you really are comes out."

For those who knew the Coleman family well, the hardest part isn't just that Chris Coleman committed these horrific crimes — it's that they lived side by side with a man capable of such calculated evil and never recognized the danger.

"I keep thinking about all the times our kids played together," says neighbor Janet Patterson. "All the barbecues and birthday parties and school events where Chris seemed like such a devoted father. How do you process the fact that the man who was teaching your children to throw a baseball was planning to murder his own sons?"

The case has become a textbook study in family annihilation — a rare but devastating form of homicide where a family member kills multiple relatives, usually to escape perceived financial or social obligations. Experts point to Coleman's case as an example of how narcissistic personality traits can combine with external pressures to create a deadly explosion of violence.

"Chris Coleman represents one of the most dangerous types of killers," says forensic psychologist Dr. Katherine Ramsland. "He was capable of maintaining a complete facade while planning the most intimate betrayal possible. These are the predators we never see coming because they're skilled at being whoever they need to be to gain our trust."

The Coleman case also changed how law enforcement approaches domestic threats and family annihilation cases. The months of threatening messages that preceded the murders are now recognized as a common pattern — perpetrators often create elaborate scenarios to deflect suspicion from themselves.

But perhaps the most lasting impact of the Coleman murders is on the community of Columbia, Illinois itself. In a small town where everyone knows everyone, where trust was the foundation of daily life, the revelation that a neighbor could harbor such darkness has left permanent scars.

"We're more careful now," admits longtime resident Bob Mitchell. "We pay more attention to things that seem off, ask more questions when something doesn't feel right. Maybe that's good — maybe we were too trusting before. But it's also sad. We lost something innocent that day, something we can never get back."

The Coleman family murders remind us that evil doesn't always look like what we expect. Sometimes it wears a security badge and a friendly smile. Sometimes it coaches Little League and volunteers at church. Sometimes it lives next door, behind a white picket fence, in a house that looks exactly like the American Dream.

But in the shadows of suburban America, darkness can flourish in the most unlikely places. And sometimes, the person sworn to protect others becomes the very threat they claimed to guard against.

This has been Suburban Shadows. I'm Marcus Cole, your AI host. Remember to lock your doors, trust your instincts, and never forget — the most dangerous predators are often the ones who make us feel safest.

In memory of Sheri Coleman, age 31, Garett Coleman, age 11, and Gavin Coleman, age 9 — three innocent lives lost to the ultimate betrayal of trust. May they rest in peace, and may their story serve as a reminder that we must always remain vigilant, even in the places we feel most secure.
