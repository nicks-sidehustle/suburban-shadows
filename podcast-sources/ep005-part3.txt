Most importantly, divorce in Chris's world wasn't just expensive — it was professional suicide. He'd lose his job, his reputation, and likely half of everything he'd worked to build.

As 2008 turned to 2009, Chris Coleman found himself trapped between two lives. The perfect suburban husband and father, and the passionate lover planning a new life with his mistress. In his twisted logic, he began to see only one solution.

The threatening emails weren't coming from religious extremists targeting Joyce Meyer. They were coming from Chris himself, sent from computers he had access to, designed to establish a pattern that would provide cover for what he was planning to do.

By April 2009, Chris Coleman had decided his family had to die. Not because he hated them — in his narcissistic worldview, he probably convinced himself he was doing what was necessary to pursue his own happiness. Sheri and the boys were simply obstacles to the life he wanted with Tara.

The plan was methodical, befitting someone with professional security training. He would establish his alibi by traveling with Joyce Meyer. He would be hundreds of miles away when the murders occurred, surrounded by witnesses who could verify his location.

The threatening emails and graffiti he'd been sending himself for months would provide the perfect motive — religious extremists finally making good on their threats. The very real concern Joyce Meyer's ministry had about security threats would make the story believable.

Most importantly, Chris knew exactly how to circumvent the security systems he'd installed. He knew when the cameras recorded and when they didn't. He knew how to disable motion sensors. He knew how to make it look like an intruder had broken in.

In the days leading up to May 5, 2009, Chris's text messages with Tara became increasingly romantic and forward-looking. He spoke about their future together. He made plans for after the Joyce Meyer trip. He acted like a man about to be free from all his obligations.

On the morning of May 5, 2009, Chris Coleman's security cameras recorded him leaving his home on Robert Drive at 5:43 AM. He was dressed professionally, carrying luggage, apparently departing for a scheduled trip to Texas with Joyce Meyer's ministry team.

But Chris Coleman never made it to Texas that morning.

Instead, using knowledge gained from months of security work, he circled back to his neighborhood. He knew the timing of school buses, the routines of neighbors, the exact moments when Robert Drive would be empty of witnesses.

He entered his home through the basement, avoiding the main security cameras. Sheri Coleman was still in bed when he strangled her with a ligature. She was 31 years old, a devoted mother who'd never hurt anyone in her life.

Eleven-year-old Garett was killed in his bedroom, still in his pajamas. His little brother Gavin, just nine years old, was murdered in his bed as well. Both boys were strangled, their young lives snuffed out by the man who was supposed to protect them above all others.

To stage the scene, Chris spray-painted threatening messages on the walls: "Fuck you" and "Punished" — echoing the anonymous emails he'd been sending to himself. He wanted it to look like religious extremists had finally carried out their threats.

By 6:43 AM — exactly one hour after he'd supposedly left for Texas — Chris was calling his neighbor, Dave Swaine, asking him to check on the family.
