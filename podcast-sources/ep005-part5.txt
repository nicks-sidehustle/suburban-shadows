Chris Coleman's trial began on April 19, 2011, exactly two years after his arrest. The prosecution, led by Monroe County State's Attorney Chris Hitzemann, methodically dismantled Coleman's claims of innocence.

The evidence was overwhelming. The cell phone pings placing him at the scene. The computer records showing he'd sent the threatening emails to himself. The affair that provided clear motive. The timeline that made his alibi impossible.

Coleman's defense team argued that the case was circumstantial. They suggested religious extremists had indeed carried out the threats. They questioned the reliability of cell phone pings and computer evidence.

But the jury saw through Chris Coleman's lies. They saw a narcissistic man who had valued his own desires above the lives of his wife and children. A security expert who had used his professional knowledge to plan what he thought would be the perfect crime.

After deliberating for just four hours, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts: three counts of first-degree murder.

Judge Milton Wharton sentenced Chris Coleman to life in prison without the possibility of parole for each murder — three consecutive life sentences. "You committed these crimes for selfish, cowardly reasons," Judge Wharton told Coleman. "You showed no mercy to your victims, and you deserve no mercy from this court."

Chris Coleman, who had once protected others from threats, would spend the rest of his life in protective custody in an Illinois maximum-security prison.

The house on Robert Drive sat empty for months after the murders. Eventually it was sold, but the new owners couldn't escape the shadow of what had happened there. Property records show it's changed hands several times since 2009, each sale at a significant loss.

Joyce Meyer Ministries conducted a thorough review of their security protocols after the Coleman case. The ministry implemented new background check procedures and psychological evaluations for security staff. They also established a victim assistance fund to help the extended Coleman family with counseling and other needs.

Tara Lintz, the woman Chris Coleman thought he was freeing himself to be with, testified against him at trial. She expressed horror at learning the true cost of their affair and has reportedly struggled with guilt over her role in the tragedy.

Chris Coleman represents one of the most chilling types of suburban predators — the man who uses trust as a weapon. His neighbors trusted him because of his job protecting others. His wife trusted him because he was her high school sweetheart. His children trusted him because he was their father.

But trust, in the wrong hands, becomes a tool of manipulation and ultimately destruction. Coleman used his security expertise not to protect his family, but to plan their murders. He used his position of authority to deflect suspicion. He used his neighbors' goodwill to establish his alibi.

The case reminds us that evil doesn't always come from strangers in dark alleys. Sometimes it lives in the house next door, coaches Little League, and attends church on Sundays. Sometimes the person we trust most is the person we should fear most.

In Columbia, Illinois, the streetlights burn a little brighter now. Security systems are checked more carefully. Neighbors pay attention to things they might have overlooked before.

Because the Coleman case taught them all a terrible lesson: Not everyone who claims to protect you has your best interests at heart. And sometimes the greatest threat isn't the stranger at the door — it's the man with the security badge, the perfect family photo, and the darkest of secrets.

This has been Suburban Shadows. I'm Marcus Cole, your AI host, reminding you to stay vigilant, stay safe, and remember — not everyone who smiles at you over the backyard fence has your best interests at heart.

Sleep well, but keep your doors locked. The predators among us are often the last ones we'd suspect.
