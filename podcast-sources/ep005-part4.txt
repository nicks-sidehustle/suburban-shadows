"I've been trying to call Sheri all morning," Chris told his neighbor, his voice carefully modulated to sound concerned but not panicked. "She's not answering her phone. The boys should be getting ready for school. Can you just go over and make sure everything's okay?"

When Dave Swaine entered the Coleman home using a key Chris had given him, he found a scene of unspeakable horror. Three members of a loving family, brutally murdered in their own beds, their home defiled with hateful graffiti.

Detective Justin Barlow had been following the Coleman threat case for months. When he got the call about the murders on May 5, his first thought was that the anonymous threatener had finally made good on his promises.

But as Barlow processed the crime scene, things didn't add up. The security system Chris had installed should have captured any intruder. The cameras showed Chris leaving that morning, but no one entering. The motion sensors hadn't been triggered. The new locks Chris had installed showed no signs of forced entry.

More suspicious was the timing. How had the killer known exactly when Chris would be away? How had they known the family's morning routine well enough to strike at the precise moment when Sheri and the boys would be vulnerable?

The graffiti looked staged — too neat, too carefully placed to be the work of someone in the heat of violent passion. Real crime scenes are chaotic. This one looked... choreographed.

Within hours, Barlow's suspicions focused on Chris Coleman himself. By the time Chris arrived home from his supposed business trip, investigators were already treating him as a suspect rather than a grieving widower.

The facade began to crumble immediately. Chris's demeanor was all wrong. He seemed more concerned with controlling the narrative than mourning his family. When reporters arrived, he positioned himself carefully for cameras. At the funeral, mourners noted that he spent more time checking his appearance than comforting relatives.

But it was technology that would ultimately prove Chris Coleman's guilt.

Cell phone records were devastating to Chris Coleman's alibi. While he claimed to be 140 miles away in Texas when the murders occurred, his phone had pinged cell towers near his home in Columbia at the exact time the coroner determined his family had died.

GPS data from his car told a more complete story. Instead of driving straight to the airport for his flight to Texas, Coleman's vehicle had made a suspicious detour — circling back toward Robert Drive during the window when the murders occurred.

Computer forensic analysis of the threatening emails revealed they had all been sent from computers Chris Coleman had access to — work computers at Joyce Meyer Ministries, public computers at libraries he frequented, and eventually, his own home computer when he'd grown careless.

Most damaging was the affair with Tara Lintz. Text message records revealed hundreds of intimate communications between Chris and Tara in the days leading up to the murders. The messages painted a picture of a man desperately eager to start a new life, unencumbered by his current family obligations.

"I can't wait to be free to love you the way you deserve," Chris had texted Tara just three days before the murders. "Soon we'll be together and nothing will keep us apart."

Phone records showed Chris had been in contact with Tara even as police were processing the crime scene of his family's murders. While his neighbors and relatives grieved, Chris Coleman was planning his new life with his mistress.
