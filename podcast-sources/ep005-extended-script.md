# Suburban Shadows - Episode 005: The Security Expert (Extended Version)

## INTRO

Picture this: A pristine suburban home in Columbia, Illinois. Population 10,000. White picket fence. Manicured lawn. Children's bicycles scattered across a driveway. A family man who made his living protecting others from the very danger he was about to unleash upon those he claimed to love most.

I'm Marcus Cole, your AI host, and this is Suburban Shadows — where we explore the dark mysteries hidden behind America's most perfect facades.

Tonight, we delve into a case that shattered not just one family, but an entire community's faith in the people sworn to protect them. This is the story of Chris Coleman — a security expert who became the very threat he was paid to eliminate. A man who understood better than anyone how to make people feel safe, and used that knowledge to commit the perfect crime. Except, of course, it wasn't perfect at all.

## PART ONE: THE AMERICAN DREAM

Columbia, Illinois is the kind of place people move to when they want to live the American dream. A suburb of St. Louis, it's all tree-lined streets and community baseball games. The kind of place where neighbors know each other's names and kids ride their bikes until the streetlights come on.

Chris Coleman seemed to embody everything Columbia represented. Born in 1977, he was a local boy who'd made good. High school football player. Married his sweetheart right after graduation. Worked his way up in the security field until he landed what many would consider a dream job — head of security for Joyce Meyer Ministries.

Joyce Meyer isn't just any televangelist. Her ministry is a multi-million dollar operation, reaching millions of viewers worldwide. Her conferences pack arenas. Her books fill bestseller lists. And with that kind of profile comes very real security concerns. Death threats from religious extremists. Overzealous fans who might pose a danger. The constant possibility that someone might try to harm Joyce or her staff.

Chris Coleman was the man responsible for preventing any of that from happening. He coordinated with local law enforcement in every city they visited. He scanned crowds for suspicious behavior. He was trained in threat assessment, crisis management, and protection protocols. At $100,000 a year, it was prestigious work that required absolute trust and unimpeachable character.

At home on Robert Drive, Chris and Sheri Coleman seemed to have it all. Sheri was beautiful, blonde, and devoted — the kind of wife who made elaborate Halloween costumes for their boys and never missed a school function. Garett, eleven, was developing into an athlete like his father. Nine-year-old Gavin was the family comedian, always ready with a joke or a silly face.

The Colemans were active at Grace Church. Chris coached his sons' Little League teams. Neighbors described them as the perfect family. If there was any trouble in paradise, they kept it well hidden behind their suburban smile.

## PART TWO: THE THREATS BEGIN

In November 2008, the Coleman family's perfect world began to crack. It started with an email — anonymous, threatening, targeted at Chris's work with Joyce Meyer Ministries.

"Fuck you all," the message read. "This is the first and last warning. You have been warned. Leave the fake, demonic, lying woman of God [Joyce Meyer] permanently. If you do not, consequences will be faced."

Chris did what any security professional would do. He documented the threat. He reported it to the Columbia Police Department. He increased security at the family home — new locks, security cameras, motion sensors. Everything by the book.

But the threats didn't stop. They escalated. More emails arrived, each more specific and menacing than the last. The anonymous sender seemed to know intimate details about the Coleman family's routine. When Chris would be traveling. When Sheri would be home alone with the boys.

"I know your schedule," one message taunted. "I know when you leave. I know when you get home. I know everything about your family."

Then came the graffiti. Someone spray-painted threatening messages on the Coleman family garage. Red paint on white doors — impossible to miss, impossible to ignore. The messages were crude but clear: "I am always watching."

The Columbia Police Department took the threats seriously. This wasn't some random prank. Someone was clearly targeting the Coleman family specifically because of Chris's high-profile job. Detective Justin Barlow was assigned to the case. He interviewed neighbors, checked security footage, followed up on every lead.

But what Detective Barlow didn't know — what no one knew — was that Chris Coleman was living a double life. And the threats that seemed to terrorize his family were actually part of an elaborate plan to eliminate them.

## PART THREE: THE SECRET LIFE

While Chris Coleman projected the image of a devoted Christian husband and father, he was conducting a passionate affair with Tara Lintz, a cocktail waitress from Florida who had once been a friend of Sheri's.

The affair had been going on for more than two years. What started as flirtation had evolved into something much deeper and more dangerous. Chris and Tara exchanged hundreds of text messages and emails. They talked about a future together. They planned for a life that didn't include Sheri and the boys.

"I love you and can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you," Chris wrote to Tara in early 2009. "You make me feel alive in a way I never have before."

But there was a problem — several problems, actually. First, Chris worked for a Christian ministry with strict moral standards. Adultery wasn't just frowned upon; it was grounds for immediate termination. Joyce Meyer Ministries had a zero-tolerance policy for staff members who violated biblical principles in their personal lives.

Second, Chris had signed a morality clause when he took the job. Any hint of scandal could cost him his $100,000-a-year salary, his prestigious title, and his comfortable lifestyle. 

Most importantly, divorce in Chris's world wasn't just expensive — it was professional suicide. He'd lose his job, his reputation, and likely half of everything he'd worked to build.

As 2008 turned to 2009, Chris Coleman found himself trapped between two lives. The perfect suburban husband and father, and the passionate lover planning a new life with his mistress. In his twisted logic, he began to see only one solution.

The threatening emails weren't coming from religious extremists targeting Joyce Meyer. They were coming from Chris himself, sent from computers he had access to, designed to establish a pattern that would provide cover for what he was planning to do.

## PART FOUR: THE PLAN

By April 2009, Chris Coleman had decided his family had to die. Not because he hated them — in his narcissistic worldview, he probably convinced himself he was doing what was necessary to pursue his own happiness. Sheri and the boys were simply obstacles to the life he wanted with Tara.

The plan was methodical, befitting someone with professional security training. He would establish his alibi by traveling with Joyce Meyer. He would be hundreds of miles away when the murders occurred, surrounded by witnesses who could verify his location.

The threatening emails and graffiti he'd been sending himself for months would provide the perfect motive — religious extremists finally making good on their threats. The very real concern Joyce Meyer's ministry had about security threats would make the story believable.

Most importantly, Chris knew exactly how to circumvent the security systems he'd installed. He knew when the cameras recorded and when they didn't. He knew how to disable motion sensors. He knew how to make it look like an intruder had broken in.

In the days leading up to May 5, 2009, Chris's text messages with Tara became increasingly romantic and forward-looking. He spoke about their future together. He made plans for after the Joyce Meyer trip. He acted like a man about to be free from all his obligations.

What he didn't count on was how thoroughly modern technology would document his every movement, and how impossible it would be to fool investigators who were every bit as trained as he was.

## PART FIVE: MAY 5, 2009 - THE MURDERS

On the morning of May 5, 2009, Chris Coleman's security cameras recorded him leaving his home on Robert Drive at 5:43 AM. He was dressed professionally, carrying luggage, apparently departing for a scheduled trip to Texas with Joyce Meyer's ministry team.

But Chris Coleman never made it to Texas that morning.

Instead, using knowledge gained from months of security work, he circled back to his neighborhood. He knew the timing of school buses, the routines of neighbors, the exact moments when Robert Drive would be empty of witnesses.

He entered his home through the basement, avoiding the main security cameras. Sheri Coleman was still in bed when he strangled her with a ligature. She was 31 years old, a devoted mother who'd never hurt anyone in her life.

Eleven-year-old Garett was killed in his bedroom, still in his pajamas. His little brother Gavin, just nine years old, was murdered in his bed as well. Both boys were strangled, their young lives snuffed out by the man who was supposed to protect them above all others.

To stage the scene, Chris spray-painted threatening messages on the walls: "Fuck you" and "Punished" — echoing the anonymous emails he'd been sending to himself. He wanted it to look like religious extremists had finally carried out their threats.

By 6:43 AM — exactly one hour after he'd supposedly left for Texas — Chris was calling his neighbor, Dave Swaine, asking him to check on the family.

"I've been trying to call Sheri all morning," Chris told his neighbor, his voice carefully modulated to sound concerned but not panicked. "She's not answering her phone. The boys should be getting ready for school. Can you just go over and make sure everything's okay?"

When Dave Swaine entered the Coleman home using a key Chris had given him, he found a scene of unspeakable horror. Three members of a loving family, brutally murdered in their own beds, their home defiled with hateful graffiti.

The first call wasn't to 911. It was back to Chris Coleman, who feigned shock and immediately said he was rushing home from his business trip.

## PART SIX: THE INVESTIGATION

Detective Justin Barlow had been following the Coleman threat case for months. When he got the call about the murders on May 5, his first thought was that the anonymous threatener had finally made good on his promises.

But as Barlow processed the crime scene, things didn't add up. The security system Chris had installed should have captured any intruder. The cameras showed Chris leaving that morning, but no one entering. The motion sensors hadn't been triggered. The new locks Chris had installed showed no signs of forced entry.

More suspicious was the timing. How had the killer known exactly when Chris would be away? How had they known the family's morning routine well enough to strike at the precise moment when Sheri and the boys would be vulnerable?

The graffiti looked staged — too neat, too carefully placed to be the work of someone in the heat of violent passion. Real crime scenes are chaotic. This one looked... choreographed.

Within hours, Barlow's suspicions focused on Chris Coleman himself. By the time Chris arrived home from his supposed business trip, investigators were already treating him as a suspect rather than a grieving widower.

The facade began to crumble immediately. Chris's demeanor was all wrong. He seemed more concerned with controlling the narrative than mourning his family. When reporters arrived, he positioned himself carefully for cameras. At the funeral, mourners noted that he spent more time checking his appearance than comforting relatives.

But it was technology that would ultimately prove Chris Coleman's guilt.

## PART SEVEN: THE EVIDENCE

Cell phone records were devastating to Chris Coleman's alibi. While he claimed to be 140 miles away in Texas when the murders occurred, his phone had pinged cell towers near his home in Columbia at the exact time the coroner determined his family had died.

GPS data from his car told a more complete story. Instead of driving straight to the airport for his flight to Texas, Coleman's vehicle had made a suspicious detour — circling back toward Robert Drive during the window when the murders occurred.

Computer forensic analysis of the threatening emails revealed they had all been sent from computers Chris Coleman had access to — work computers at Joyce Meyer Ministries, public computers at libraries he frequented, and eventually, his own home computer when he'd grown careless.

Most damaging was the affair with Tara Lintz. Text message records revealed hundreds of intimate communications between Chris and Tara in the days leading up to the murders. The messages painted a picture of a man desperately eager to start a new life, unencumbered by his current family obligations.

"I can't wait to be free to love you the way you deserve," Chris had texted Tara just three days before the murders. "Soon we'll be together and nothing will keep us apart."

Phone records showed Chris had been in contact with Tara even as police were processing the crime scene of his family's murders. While his neighbors and relatives grieved, Chris Coleman was planning his new life with his mistress.

## PART EIGHT: THE TRIAL AND VERDICT

Chris Coleman's trial began on April 19, 2011, exactly two years after his arrest. The prosecution, led by Monroe County State's Attorney Chris Hitzemann, methodically dismantled Coleman's claims of innocence.

The evidence was overwhelming. The cell phone pings placing him at the scene. The computer records showing he'd sent the threatening emails to himself. The affair that provided clear motive. The timeline that made his alibi impossible.

Coleman's defense team, led by William Margulis, argued that the case was circumstantial. They suggested religious extremists had indeed carried out the threats. They questioned the reliability of cell phone pings and computer evidence.

But the jury saw through Chris Coleman's lies. They saw a narcissistic man who had valued his own desires above the lives of his wife and children. A security expert who had used his professional knowledge to plan what he thought would be the perfect crime.

After deliberating for just four hours, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts: three counts of first-degree murder.

Judge Milton Wharton sentenced Chris Coleman to life in prison without the possibility of parole for each murder — three consecutive life sentences. "You committed these crimes for selfish, cowardly reasons," Judge Wharton told Coleman. "You showed no mercy to your victims, and you deserve no mercy from this court."

Chris Coleman, who had once protected others from threats, would spend the rest of his life in protective custody in an Illinois maximum-security prison.

## PART NINE: THE AFTERMATH

The house on Robert Drive sat empty for months after the murders. Eventually it was sold, but the new owners couldn't escape the shadow of what had happened there. Property records show it's changed hands several times since 2009, each sale at a significant loss.

Joyce Meyer Ministries conducted a thorough review of their security protocols after the Coleman case. The ministry implemented new background check procedures and psychological evaluations for security staff. They also established a victim assistance fund to help the extended Coleman family with counseling and other needs.

Tara Lintz, the woman Chris Coleman thought he was freeing himself to be with, testified against him at trial. She expressed horror at learning the true cost of their affair and has reportedly struggled with guilt over her role in the tragedy.

The Columbia community was left to grapple with a devastating truth — the man they'd trusted to keep them safe had been the greatest threat all along.

## EPILOGUE: THE PREDATOR NEXT DOOR

Chris Coleman represents one of the most chilling types of suburban predators — the man who uses trust as a weapon. His neighbors trusted him because of his job protecting others. His wife trusted him because he was her high school sweetheart. His children trusted him because he was their father.

But trust, in the wrong hands, becomes a tool of manipulation and ultimately destruction. Coleman used his security expertise not to protect his family, but to plan their murders. He used his position of authority to deflect suspicion. He used his neighbors' goodwill to establish his alibi.

The case reminds us that evil doesn't always come from strangers in dark alleys. Sometimes it lives in the house next door, coaches Little League, and attends church on Sundays. Sometimes the person we trust most is the person we should fear most.

In Columbia, Illinois, the streetlights burn a little brighter now. Security systems are checked more carefully. Neighbors pay attention to things they might have overlooked before.

Because the Coleman case taught them all a terrible lesson: Not everyone who claims to protect you has your best interests at heart. And sometimes the greatest threat isn't the stranger at the door — it's the man with the security badge, the perfect family photo, and the darkest of secrets.

The suburban dream of safety and trust died on Robert Drive on May 5, 2009. But perhaps from that tragedy, we can learn to be more vigilant, more aware, and less willing to accept the surface perfection that hides the monsters among us.

This has been Suburban Shadows. I'm Marcus Cole, your AI host, reminding you to stay vigilant, stay safe, and remember — not everyone who smiles at you over the backyard fence has your best interests at heart.

Sleep well, but keep your doors locked. The predators among us are often the last ones we'd suspect.
