## "When ChatGPT Passed the Bar (of Lying)"

## THE INCIDENT

In June 2023, attorneys Steven Schwartz and Peter LoDuca of the law firm Levidow, Levidow & Oberman filed a legal brief in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case was Mata v. Avianca Airlines — a personal injury lawsuit where Roberto Mata claimed he was injured when a metal serving cart struck his knee during a flight.

The brief cited six court cases as legal precedent to support their arguments.

There was just one problem: **none of the six cases existed.**

---

## THE FAKE CASES

The fabricated citations included:

1. **Varghese v. China Southern Airlines Co Ltd** — supposedly from the 11th Circuit
2. **Shaboon v. Egyptair** — allegedly a 2013 case  
3. **Petersen v. Iran Air** — cited with specific page numbers
4. **Martinez v. Delta Airlines** — complete with fake volume and reporter citations
5. **Estate of Durden v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines** — entirely invented
6. **Miller v. United Airlines** — never happened

Each citation looked completely legitimate — proper formatting, realistic case names, plausible court references, even page numbers.

## HOW IT UNFOLDED

1. **The Filing**: Schwartz used ChatGPT to research case law, asking it to find cases supporting their position
2. **ChatGPT Delivered**: The AI provided six cases with full citations
3. **Schwartz Trusted It**: He included them in the brief without verification
4. **Opposing Counsel Noticed**: Avianca's lawyers couldn't find any of the cited cases
5. **The Court Demanded Answers**: Judge P. Kevin Castel ordered Schwartz to provide copies of the decisions
6. **The Cover-Up Attempt**: Schwartz asked ChatGPT to provide the full text of the decisions... and it fabricated those too
7. **The Admission**: When the fake opinions were also questioned, Schwartz finally admitted he'd used ChatGPT

---

## THE COURT'S RESPONSE

Judge Castel was not amused. In his order, he wrote:

> "Six of the submitted cases appear to be bogus judicial decisions with bogus quotes and bogus internal citations."

He noted that the fabricated cases contained:
- Invented judicial reasoning
- Fake quotes attributed to real judges
- Citations to other non-existent cases within the fake opinions
- Fabricated procedural histories

---

## THE SANCTIONS

On June 22, 2023, Judge Castel sanctioned both attorneys:

- **$5,000 fine each** (total $10,000)
- Required to **send letters to every judge** falsely cited in the fabricated opinions
- Public humiliation through extensive media coverage
- Referred to the Grievance Committee for potential bar discipline

Schwartz told the court he "greatly regrets" the situation and was "unaware that [ChatGPT's] content could be false."

## WHY CHATGPT INVENTS LEGAL CASES

ChatGPT doesn't "know" case law — it predicts what a legal citation should look like based on patterns:

1. **Case naming conventions**: "[Party] v. [Party]" is easy to generate
2. **Court formatting**: "11th Cir." or "S.D.N.Y." follows predictable patterns
3. **Citation formats**: Volume numbers, reporters, page numbers — all formulaic
4. **Topical relevance**: If asked about airline injuries, it generates airline-related party names

The AI creates statistically plausible text, not factually accurate information. It has no database of real cases — just patterns of how case citations look.

## THE BROADER IMPACT

This case became a watershed moment:

### Immediate Effects:
- **Courts nationwide** began requiring AI disclosure in filings
- **Bar associations** issued ethics guidance on AI use
- **Law firms** implemented AI verification policies
- **Legal tech companies** rushed to create AI verification tools

### Standing Orders Issued:
Multiple federal judges issued standing orders requiring:
- Disclosure of any AI-assisted research
- Certification that all citations have been verified
- Some courts banned AI use entirely for legal research

### Similar Incidents Surfaced:
- A Colorado attorney cited fake cases in April 2023
- A Canadian tribunal found fabricated cases in a submission
- Multiple other incidents were reported after the Mata case made headlines

---

## THE HUMAN ELEMENT

Steven Schwartz had been practicing law for over 30 years. He wasn't a tech novice or a careless attorney — he was an experienced litigator who made a catastrophic assumption: that a sophisticated AI system would only provide real information.

In his affidavit, he explained:
- He had never used ChatGPT before for legal research
- He asked ChatGPT if the cases were real, and it confirmed they were
- He believed ChatGPT was a reliable "super search engine"
- He did not understand that AI could confidently fabricate content

This highlights a fundamental problem: **AI systems present fabricated information with the same confidence as verified facts.**

---

## LESSONS FOR EVERYONE (Not Just Lawyers)

### 1. AI Confidence ≠ AI Accuracy
ChatGPT delivered fake cases with perfect formatting and zero hedging. It didn't say "I think there might be a case..." — it provided complete citations as if reading from a database.

### 2. Verification Is Non-Negotiable
Any AI-generated factual claim must be independently verified. This applies to:
- Legal citations
- Academic references
- Statistics and data
- Historical claims
- Biographical information

### 3. "I Didn't Know" Isn't a Defense
Schwartz's claim that he didn't know ChatGPT could hallucinate didn't save him. Professionals are expected to understand their tools.

### 4. The Stakes Are Real
This wasn't a homework assignment — it was a federal court filing. The consequences included fines, professional embarrassment, potential bar discipline, and damage to their client's case.

## PODCAST DISCUSSION ANGLES

Interesting questions to explore:
- Why do we instinctively trust AI systems that "sound smart"?
- How is this different from trusting a bad Google search result?
- What's the right level of AI skepticism without being a luddite?
- Should AI companies be liable when their outputs cause professional harm?
- How do we train the next generation of professionals to use AI responsibly?
- Is "I asked ChatGPT if it was lying and it said no" the modern equivalent of "the dog ate my homework"?

Lighter angles:
- The irony of asking ChatGPT to produce fake decisions to prove the first fake decisions were real
- The mental image of a 30-year lawyer asking ChatGPT "are you sure these are real?" and it confidently replying "yes"
- The awkward letters these attorneys had to send to judges: "Dear Your Honor, sorry we said you wrote something you didn't..."
