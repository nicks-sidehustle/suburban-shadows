Good evening. I'm Marcus Cole, your AI-generated host. The voice you're hearing is synthesized, but the stories are real, thoroughly researched, and treated with the respect they deserve.

Tonight, we journey to the quiet suburbs of West Knox County, Tennessee, where Goldview Lane winds through a neighborhood of well-maintained homes and manicured lawns. It's the kind of place where neighbors wave to each other, where children ride bicycles on sidewalks, and where the most excitement might be a yard sale on Saturday morning.

In November 2016, one house on this peaceful street would become the epicenter of a crime so meticulously planned and brutally executed that even seasoned investigators would struggle to process what they found. This is the story of a family's final Thanksgiving together, and how the promise of financial independence became a death sentence.

Joel Guy Senior was 61 years old in the fall of 2016, a pipeline engineering designer who had spent his career building the infrastructure that keeps our modern world running. His wife Lisa, 55, worked in human resources and accounts payable at Jacobs Engineering in nearby Oak Ridge. They were the kind of couple you'd find at any suburban church on Sunday morning — hardworking, dedicated to their family, planning for a peaceful retirement.

After 31 years of marriage, Joel and Lisa had reached that golden milestone many couples dream of: they were finally ready to retire. They had recently sold their Knoxville home and purchased Joel's late mother's house in Surgoinsville, Tennessee, about 80 miles away. The plan was simple and sweet — move to the small town where Joel had grown up, slow down, and enjoy the fruits of their decades of labor.

But there was one complication in their retirement plans. Their 28-year-old son, Joel Junior.

Joel Michael Guy Junior had been living what can only be described as a professional student lifestyle. For nine years, he had been enrolled in various programs, ostensibly working toward becoming a plastic surgeon. He lived in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and had never held a job. Not once. His parents had been supporting him entirely — paying for his education, his living expenses, his car, everything.

Those who knew the family described Lisa as particularly devoted to her son. She doted on him, always ready with financial help or emotional support. But by 2016, even her patience was wearing thin. Joel Junior was 28 years old, had been in school for nearly a decade, and seemed no closer to actually becoming a doctor than when he started.

So Joel and Lisa made a decision that thousands of parents make every year. They decided it was time for tough love. They were going to cut off his financial support and focus on their own retirement. The money that had been flowing to Baton Rouge to support their son would stop. Joel Junior would have to stand on his own two feet.

It seemed like a reasonable decision. A necessary decision. A decision that would cost them their lives.

The plan began forming in Joel Junior's mind sometime in early November 2016. And unlike his college career, this was something he approached with methodical precision.

On November 7th, nearly three weeks before Thanksgiving, security cameras captured Joel Junior at an Ace Hardware store in Napoleonville, Louisiana. He paid cash for muriatic acid and food-grade hydrogen peroxide. On November 18th, he was recorded at Home Depot, purchasing a bleach sprayer, extension cords, and a timer. The next day, Academy Sports cameras caught him buying a knife. November 21st brought him to a Knoxville Walmart, where he purchased blue storage totes.

Each transaction was paid for in cash. Each purchase was made through self-checkout when possible. This wasn't impulse shopping — this was procurement for a mission.

But the most chilling evidence of premeditation would be discovered later: a handwritten notebook that prosecutors would call "the book of premeditation." In his own handwriting, Joel Junior had created a step-by-step manual for murder.

"Kill him with the knife," read one entry. "Clean up mess from him before she gets home."

The notebook was disturbingly thorough. It detailed how to use sodium hydroxide to destroy soft tissue and soften bones. It included reminders to "baste once every hour to accelerate" the decomposition process. It suggested turning the heat up to 90 degrees because heat "speeds up decomposition" and "melts fingerprints."

One entry was particularly telling: "Flush chunks down toilet, not garbage disposal. Don't have to get rid of body if no forensic evidence."

And then there was the motive, written plainly in his own hand: "$500,000 would be all mine. With him missing/dead, I get the whole thing."

Joel Junior was the beneficiary of his parents' life insurance policy. Half a million dollars if both parents died. To him, apparently, this seemed like an easier solution than getting a job.

Thanksgiving 2016 arrived as it does every year — a time for family, gratitude, and togetherness. Joel Junior drove from Baton Rouge to his parents' home on Goldview Lane, joining his three half-sisters for what everyone believed would be their last holiday in the family home before his parents moved to Surgoinsville.

The weekend progressed normally. Family conversations, shared meals, the comfortable rhythms of people who had known each other for decades. Joel Junior's sisters later said he seemed fine, nothing out of the ordinary. They had no idea that tucked away in his backpack was a notebook filled with detailed plans for murder.

November 26th, 2016. The Saturday after Thanksgiving.

Lisa Guy decided to make a trip to Walmart for groceries. Security cameras captured her at approximately 12:15 PM, selecting items for what she believed would be just another weekend shopping trip. She had no way of knowing that while she was gone, her husband was fighting for his life in their upstairs exercise room.

Joel Junior attacked his father first, just as his notebook had planned. The 61-year-old engineer was stabbed 42 times. The force of the assault was so violent that it tore the blinds, left blood splattered on the walls, and overturned a Bowflex machine. Evidence suggests Joel Senior fought desperately, but he was no match for his younger, stronger son armed with a knife.

In the struggle, Joel Junior cut his own hands severely, including a deep gash to his left thumb. These wounds would become crucial evidence later.

When Lisa returned home, she entered through the front door, dropped her grocery bags in the foyer, and headed upstairs. She found her son waiting for her. He stabbed her 31 times, severing nine of her ribs in the process. The woman who had supported and loved him unconditionally died at his hands.

But Joel Junior's work was far from finished. His notebook had prepared him for what came next.

What happened in that house over the next several hours defies comprehension. Joel Junior set about dismembering his parents' bodies with the methodical approach of someone following a recipe.

He cut off his father's hands at the wrists and left them on the exercise room floor. He severed both parents' limbs — his father at the waist, his mother at the knees. He made large gashes in both bodies so that the chemicals would seep more quickly into their main cavities.

He placed the torsos and limbs in large plastic containers and covered them with a caustic mixture of chemicals designed to dissolve human remains. Prosecutors would later describe these containers as holding a "diabolical stew of human remains."

Then came perhaps the most disturbing detail of all. Joel Junior carried his mother's severed head downstairs, placed it in a large stockpot, and put it on the stove to boil. When investigators arrived days later, that pot was still simmering.

But Joel Junior's plan was beginning to unravel. The injuries to his hands were severe and bleeding badly. Around 3:30 PM, Walmart security cameras captured him in the first aid section, purchasing bandages, ointment, isopropyl alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide to treat his wounds.

His notebook had included detailed instructions for cleaning up and destroying evidence. He was supposed to douse the killing rooms with bleach, turn up the heat, possibly flood or burn the house. But blood loss and the sheer physical exhaustion of his horrific task apparently overwhelmed him.

Instead of completing his cleanup, Joel Junior left. He drove back to Baton Rouge on Sunday to have his wounds properly treated at the student health clinic. His parents' remains were left in their home, partially dissolved, partially boiling, in a scene that would haunt investigators for the rest of their careers.

Monday morning came, and Lisa Guy didn't show up for work. This was completely out of character for her — she was reliable, conscientious, the kind of employee who called in if she was going to be even a few minutes late.

Her supervisor, Jennifer Whitehead, tried calling her multiple times throughout the day. No answer. Growing concerned, Whitehead contacted the Knox County Sheriff's Office and requested a welfare check.

Officers Steven Ballard and Jeremy McCord arrived at the house on Goldview Lane on November 28th. The property was for sale, but there was no realtor's lockbox on the front door. Through the windows, they could see groceries still sitting on the floor — perishable items like bacon, sausage, and ice cream that had been there since Saturday.

They noticed that the back door's doorknob had been removed and installed on the front door instead. Through the hole where the back doorknob should have been, they could feel heat radiating from inside the house and detect a strange, nauseating odor.

Using a garage door opener found in one of the family's cars, the officers gained entry to the house. What they found inside would stay with them forever.

Detective McCord later testified: "As soon as that garage door opened, we immediately felt heat. Walking through the downstairs of the house, nothing made sense to me."

The groceries Lisa had bought on Saturday were still scattered on the floor. Two wallets sat side by side on a table, next to a sledgehammer. In the kitchen, the stove was on, and something was boiling in a large pot.

As the officers moved upstairs, they heard a dog barking intermittently. They looked down the hallway and saw what Detective McCord would never forget: "You can see straight down the hall and I saw hands... not connected to a body."

The officers found Joel Senior's severed hands on the exercise room floor, surrounded by bloodstains and evidence of the violent struggle. In the bathroom, they discovered the blue plastic containers filled with what had once been human beings, now reduced to what prosecutors would call a "diabolical stew of human remains."

The smell, Detective McCord said, was indescribable. "I will never get those smells out of my head or my dreams."

The investigation moved quickly. The surveillance footage from multiple stores showed Joel Junior purchasing the exact items found at the crime scene. The notebook found in his backpack provided a literal blueprint of the murders. His wounded hands matched the blood evidence from the struggle with his father.

On November 29th, 2016, just three days after he murdered his parents, Joel Junior was arrested in the parking lot of his Baton Rouge apartment complex as he tried to get into his car. A meat grinder was found in the trunk — apparently another tool in his plan to dispose of his parents' bodies.

In a final twist of arrogance, Joel Junior had filed a motion requesting that he be given the death penalty if convicted. Perhaps he thought this would make him look innocent, or perhaps he genuinely preferred death to spending his life in prison. The state of Tennessee chose not to grant his request.

The trial began in October 2020. Joel Junior's defense team presented no evidence on his behalf — there really wasn't anything they could say. The physical evidence was overwhelming, and the defendant's own handwriting had documented his intent and planning in meticulous detail.

After four days of testimony that included graphic crime scene videos and readings from the "book of premeditation," the jury found Joel Michael Guy Junior guilty on all counts. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, plus additional time for abuse of corpses.

As of today, he remains incarcerated at Northwest Correctional Complex in Tiptonville, Tennessee, serving his life sentence.

The Guy family murders represent something deeply disturbing about modern American society. Here was a young man who had been given every advantage — loving parents, financial support, educational opportunities — and he threw it all away rather than face the prospect of adult responsibility.

Joel and Lisa Guy worked their entire lives to build a secure future for themselves and their children. They supported their son for nearly a decade, hoping he would eventually find his way to independence and success. When they finally decided that tough love was necessary, their son's response was to murder them in the most brutal way imaginable.

The case raises uncomfortable questions about entitlement, dependency, and what happens when a generation that has never faced real hardship is suddenly asked to stand on its own. Joel Junior apparently found the idea of getting a job so horrifying that murder seemed preferable.

But perhaps most chilling is the cold, calculated nature of his planning. This wasn't a crime of passion or a moment of rage. This was a deliberate, methodical execution carried out with the precision of a business plan. The notebook found in his backpack reads like a manual for murder, complete with cost-benefit analysis.

The families of Joel and Lisa Guy lost not only two beloved members, but also their sense of safety and trust. How do you reconcile the memory of family Thanksgiving dinners with the knowledge that one person at the table was planning to kill the hosts?

As I close tonight's episode, I want you to remember Joel and Lisa Guy not as victims of a horror story, but as the hardworking, loving people they were. Joel Senior, who spent his career building the infrastructure that keeps our society running. Lisa, who managed the financial side of engineering projects while raising a blended family with patience and devotion.

They were ordinary people living ordinary lives, looking forward to a well-earned retirement in the small town where Joel had grown up. Their only mistake was loving their son too much, supporting him too long, and trusting that their act of necessary parental discipline would be met with mature acceptance rather than savage violence.

Their story reminds us that evil can hide behind the most familiar faces, and that the greatest threats often come not from strangers in dark alleys, but from those we trust most completely.

This has been another episode of Suburban Shadows, where we explore the darkness that can lurk behind manicured lawns and white picket fences. I'm Marcus Cole. Stay vigilant. Stay safe.
