The plan began forming in Joel Junior's mind sometime in early November 2016. And unlike his college career, this was something he approached with methodical precision.

On November 7th, nearly three weeks before Thanksgiving, security cameras captured Joel Junior at an Ace Hardware store in Napoleonville, Louisiana. He paid cash for muriatic acid and food-grade hydrogen peroxide. On November 18th, he was recorded at Home Depot, purchasing a bleach sprayer, extension cords, and a timer. The next day, Academy Sports cameras caught him buying a knife. November 21st brought him to a Knoxville Walmart, where he purchased blue storage totes.

Each transaction was paid for in cash. Each purchase was made through self-checkout when possible. This wasn't impulse shopping — this was procurement for a mission.

But the most chilling evidence of premeditation would be discovered later: a handwritten notebook that prosecutors would call "the book of premeditation." In his own handwriting, Joel Junior had created a step-by-step manual for murder.

"Kill him with the knife," read one entry. "Clean up mess from him before she gets home."

The notebook was disturbingly thorough. It detailed how to use sodium hydroxide to destroy soft tissue and soften bones. It included reminders to "baste once every hour to accelerate" the decomposition process. It suggested turning the heat up to 90 degrees because heat "speeds up decomposition" and "melts fingerprints."

One entry was particularly telling: "Flush chunks down toilet, not garbage disposal. Don't have to get rid of body if no forensic evidence."

And then there was the motive, written plainly in his own hand: "$500,000 would be all mine. With him missing/dead, I get the whole thing."

Joel Junior was the beneficiary of his parents' life insurance policy. Half a million dollars if both parents died. To him, apparently, this seemed like an easier solution than getting a job.

Thanksgiving 2016 arrived as it does every year — a time for family, gratitude, and togetherness. Joel Junior drove from Baton Rouge to his parents' home on Goldview Lane, joining his three half-sisters for what everyone believed would be their last holiday in the family home before his parents moved to Surgoinsville.

The weekend progressed normally. Family conversations, shared meals, the comfortable rhythms of people who had known each other for decades. Joel Junior's sisters later said he seemed fine, nothing out of the ordinary. They had no idea that tucked away in his backpack was a notebook filled with detailed plans for murder.
