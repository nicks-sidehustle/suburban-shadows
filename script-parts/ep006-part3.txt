November 26th, 2016. The Saturday after Thanksgiving.

Lisa Guy decided to make a trip to Walmart for groceries. Security cameras captured her at approximately 12:15 PM, selecting items for what she believed would be just another weekend shopping trip. She had no way of knowing that while she was gone, her husband was fighting for his life in their upstairs exercise room.

Joel Junior attacked his father first, just as his notebook had planned. The 61-year-old engineer was stabbed 42 times. The force of the assault was so violent that it tore the blinds, left blood splattered on the walls, and overturned a Bowflex machine. Evidence suggests Joel Senior fought desperately, but he was no match for his younger, stronger son armed with a knife.

In the struggle, Joel Junior cut his own hands severely, including a deep gash to his left thumb. These wounds would become crucial evidence later.

When Lisa returned home, she entered through the front door, dropped her grocery bags in the foyer, and headed upstairs. She found her son waiting for her. He stabbed her 31 times, severing nine of her ribs in the process. The woman who had supported and loved him unconditionally died at his hands.

But Joel Junior's work was far from finished. His notebook had prepared him for what came next.

What happened in that house over the next several hours defies comprehension. Joel Junior set about dismembering his parents' bodies with the methodical approach of someone following a recipe.

He cut off his father's hands at the wrists and left them on the exercise room floor. He severed both parents' limbs — his father at the waist, his mother at the knees. He made large gashes in both bodies so that the chemicals would seep more quickly into their main cavities.

He placed the torsos and limbs in large plastic containers and covered them with a caustic mixture of chemicals designed to dissolve human remains. Prosecutors would later describe these containers as holding a "diabolical stew of human remains."

Then came perhaps the most disturbing detail of all. Joel Junior carried his mother's severed head downstairs, placed it in a large stockpot, and put it on the stove to boil. When investigators arrived days later, that pot was still simmering.

But Joel Junior's plan was beginning to unravel. The injuries to his hands were severe and bleeding badly. Around 3:30 PM, Walmart security cameras captured him in the first aid section, purchasing bandages, ointment, isopropyl alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide to treat his wounds.

His notebook had included detailed instructions for cleaning up and destroying evidence. He was supposed to douse the killing rooms with bleach, turn up the heat, possibly flood or burn the house. But blood loss and the sheer physical exhaustion of his horrific task apparently overwhelmed him.

Instead of completing his cleanup, Joel Junior left. He drove back to Baton Rouge on Sunday to have his wounds properly treated at the student health clinic. His parents' remains were left in their home, partially dissolved, partially boiling, in a scene that would haunt investigators for the rest of their careers.
