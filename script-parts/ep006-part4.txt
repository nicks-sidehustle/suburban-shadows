Monday morning came, and Lisa Guy didn't show up for work. This was completely out of character for her — she was reliable, conscientious, the kind of employee who called in if she was going to be even a few minutes late.

Her supervisor, Jennifer Whitehead, tried calling her multiple times throughout the day. No answer. Growing concerned, Whitehead contacted the Knox County Sheriff's Office and requested a welfare check.

Officers Steven Ballard and Jeremy McCord arrived at the house on Goldview Lane on November 28th. The property was for sale, but there was no realtor's lockbox on the front door. Through the windows, they could see groceries still sitting on the floor — perishable items like bacon, sausage, and ice cream that had been there since Saturday.

They noticed that the back door's doorknob had been removed and installed on the front door instead. Through the hole where the back doorknob should have been, they could feel heat radiating from inside the house and detect a strange, nauseating odor.

Using a garage door opener found in one of the family's cars, the officers gained entry to the house. What they found inside would stay with them forever.

Detective McCord later testified: "As soon as that garage door opened, we immediately felt heat. Walking through the downstairs of the house, nothing made sense to me."

The groceries Lisa had bought on Saturday were still scattered on the floor. Two wallets sat side by side on a table, next to a sledgehammer. In the kitchen, the stove was on, and something was boiling in a large pot.

As the officers moved upstairs, they heard a dog barking intermittently. They looked down the hallway and saw what Detective McCord would never forget: "You can see straight down the hall and I saw hands... not connected to a body."

The officers found Joel Senior's severed hands on the exercise room floor, surrounded by bloodstains and evidence of the violent struggle. In the bathroom, they discovered the blue plastic containers filled with what had once been human beings, now reduced to what prosecutors would call a "diabolical stew of human remains."

The smell, Detective McCord said, was indescribable. "I will never get those smells out of my head or my dreams."

The investigation moved quickly. The surveillance footage from multiple stores showed Joel Junior purchasing the exact items found at the crime scene. The notebook found in his backpack provided a literal blueprint of the murders. His wounded hands matched the blood evidence from the struggle with his father.

On November 29th, 2016, just three days after he murdered his parents, Joel Junior was arrested in the parking lot of his Baton Rouge apartment complex as he tried to get into his car. A meat grinder was found in the trunk — apparently another tool in his plan to dispose of his parents' bodies.

The trial began in October 2020. Joel Junior's defense team presented no evidence on his behalf — there really wasn't anything they could say. The physical evidence was overwhelming, and the defendant's own handwriting had documented his intent and planning in meticulous detail.

After four days of testimony that included graphic crime scene videos and readings from the "book of premeditation," the jury found Joel Michael Guy Junior guilty on all counts. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, plus additional time for abuse of corpses.

As of today, he remains incarcerated at Northwest Correctional Complex in Tiptonville, Tennessee, serving his life sentence.
