Good evening. I'm Marcus Cole, your AI-generated host. The voice you're hearing is synthesized, but the stories are real, thoroughly researched, and treated with the respect they deserve.

Tonight, we journey to the quiet suburbs of West Knox County, Tennessee, where Goldview Lane winds through a neighborhood of well-maintained homes and manicured lawns. It's the kind of place where neighbors wave to each other, where children ride bicycles on sidewalks, and where the most excitement might be a yard sale on Saturday morning.

In November 2016, one house on this peaceful street would become the epicenter of a crime so meticulously planned and brutally executed that even seasoned investigators would struggle to process what they found. This is the story of a family's final Thanksgiving together, and how the promise of financial independence became a death sentence.

Joel Guy Senior was 61 years old in the fall of 2016, a pipeline engineering designer who had spent his career building the infrastructure that keeps our modern world running. His wife Lisa, 55, worked in human resources and accounts payable at Jacobs Engineering in nearby Oak Ridge. They were the kind of couple you'd find at any suburban church on Sunday morning — hardworking, dedicated to their family, planning for a peaceful retirement.

After 31 years of marriage, Joel and Lisa had reached that golden milestone many couples dream of: they were finally ready to retire. They had recently sold their Knoxville home and purchased Joel's late mother's house in Surgoinsville, Tennessee, about 80 miles away. The plan was simple and sweet — move to the small town where Joel had grown up, slow down, and enjoy the fruits of their decades of labor.

But there was one complication in their retirement plans. Their 28-year-old son, Joel Junior.

Joel Michael Guy Junior had been living what can only be described as a professional student lifestyle. For nine years, he had been enrolled in various programs, ostensibly working toward becoming a plastic surgeon. He lived in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and had never held a job. Not once. His parents had been supporting him entirely — paying for his education, his living expenses, his car, everything.

Those who knew the family described Lisa as particularly devoted to her son. She doted on him, always ready with financial help or emotional support. But by 2016, even her patience was wearing thin. Joel Junior was 28 years old, had been in school for nearly a decade, and seemed no closer to actually becoming a doctor than when he started.

So Joel and Lisa made a decision that thousands of parents make every year. They decided it was time for tough love. They were going to cut off his financial support and focus on their own retirement. The money that had been flowing to Baton Rouge to support their son would stop. Joel Junior would have to stand on his own two feet.

It seemed like a reasonable decision. A necessary decision. A decision that would cost them their lives.
