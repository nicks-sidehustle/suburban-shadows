# Suburban Shadows - Episode 005: The Security Expert

## INTRO

Picture this: A pristine suburban home in Columbia, Illinois. White picket fence. Manicured lawn. A family man who made his living protecting others from the very danger he was about to unleash.

I'm Marcus Cole, your AI host, and this is Suburban Shadows — where we explore the dark mysteries hidden behind America's most perfect facades.

Tonight, we delve into a case that shattered not just one family, but an entire community's faith in the people sworn to protect them. This is the story of Chris Coleman — a security expert who became the very threat he was paid to eliminate.

## PART ONE: THE PROTECTOR

Chris Coleman was the kind of man suburban families trusted with their lives. Literally. As head of security for renowned televangelist Joyce Meyer, Coleman traveled the world, scanning crowds for threats, coordinating with local law enforcement, ensuring the safety of thousands.

At home in Columbia, Illinois, he was the picture of suburban success. Married to his high school sweetheart Sheri. Father to two beautiful boys — Garett, 11, and Gavin, 9. The family attended Grace Church regularly. Coleman coached Little League. 

To his neighbors on Robert Drive, Chris Coleman wasn't just the guy next door — he was the guy you'd call if the guy next door turned out to be dangerous.

## PART TWO: THE THREATS

In late 2008, the Coleman family began receiving disturbing messages. Threatening emails. Graffiti spray-painted on their home. Anonymous letters warning that Sheri and the boys would pay the price for Chris's work with Joyce Meyer.

"I am giving you the choice," one message read. "You have until after the first of the year. All you have to do is quit your job. If not, Sheri, Garett, Gavin will die."

Chris dutifully reported each threat to police. As a security professional, he knew the protocols. He installed cameras. Upgraded locks. Did everything right.

But what the Columbia Police Department didn't know was that Chris Coleman was living a double life.

## PART THREE: THE OTHER WOMAN

While projecting the image of a devoted Christian husband, Coleman was conducting an affair with Tara Lintz, a friend of his wife's from Florida. The relationship had been going on for years — passionate emails, secret phone calls, promises of a future together.

But there was a problem. Coleman's employer, Joyce Meyer Ministries, had strict moral clauses. Divorce wasn't just frowned upon — it could cost him his $100,000-a-year job.

In his twisted calculation, Coleman saw only one solution. His family had to die.

## PART FOUR: MAY 5, 2009

On the morning of May 5, 2009, Chris Coleman left for work as usual. Security cameras captured him departing at 5:43 AM for what was supposed to be a trip to Texas with Joyce Meyer.

At 6:43 AM, he called his neighbor, asking them to check on his family. He claimed he'd been trying to reach Sheri all morning but she wasn't answering her phone.

When police arrived at the Coleman home on Robert Drive, they found a scene of horror. Sheri Coleman, 31, was dead in the master bedroom, strangled. Her sons — Garett, 11, and Gavin, 9 — were found dead in their beds, also strangled.

Spray-painted on the walls in red were messages: "F--- you" and "Punished."

## PART FIVE: THE INVESTIGATION

From the beginning, investigators found Coleman's story suspicious. How could someone break into a house equipped with multiple security systems without triggering any alarms? How could the killer know the family's routine so precisely?

The timeline was impossible. Coleman claimed to be 140 miles away when the murders occurred, but cell phone records told a different story. His phone had pinged towers near his home at the time of the murders.

Most damning was the affair. Text messages between Coleman and Tara Lintz revealed a man desperate to start a new life. "I love you and can't wait to be with you," he'd written just days before the murders.

## PART SIX: THE FACADE CRUMBLES

As evidence mounted, Chris Coleman's mask of grief began to slip. At the funeral, witnesses noted his strange behavior — he seemed more concerned with his appearance than mourning his family. 

Phone records revealed he'd been in contact with Tara Lintz even as police were processing the crime scene. When confronted about the affair, Coleman's story constantly changed.

The threatening emails that had supposedly terrorized his family? All traced back to computers Coleman had access to. He'd been sending anonymous threats to himself.

## PART SEVEN: JUSTICE

On April 19, 2011, Chris Coleman was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.

During the trial, prosecutors painted a picture of a narcissistic man who valued his image and income more than his family's lives. The same calculating mind that had protected celebrities from threats had planned the perfect murder — except it wasn't perfect at all.

## EPILOGUE

The house on Robert Drive stands empty now, a monument to broken trust. Chris Coleman, the man who made his living protecting others, had become the very monster families like his needed protection from.

In suburban America, we trust our neighbors. We trust our community leaders. We trust the men and women who dedicate their lives to keeping us safe.

But sometimes, the greatest danger isn't the stranger at the door. Sometimes, it's the man with the security badge, the perfect family photo, and the darkest of secrets.

The lights on Robert Drive burn a little brighter now. Because sometimes, the most dangerous predator is the one who knows exactly how to make you feel safe.

This has been Suburban Shadows. I'm Marcus Cole. Stay vigilant. Stay safe. And remember — not everyone who claims to protect you has your best interests at heart.
